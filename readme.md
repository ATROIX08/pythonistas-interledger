# 🏦 Pythonistas Interledger — STP Multi-Currency Demo - IL-Cash

**Pythonistas Interledger** is a prototype for a **multi-currency STP (Sistema de Transferencias y Pagos)** built with **Flask (Python)** and **HTML/JavaScript frontend**.  
The goal is to **enable cross-currency transfers and optimize exchange rates**, simulating a **multi-network payment system** inspired by **Open Payments** and the **Interledger Protocol (ILP)**.  

> ⚙️ Developed for a hackathon — functional demo, not production-ready.

## 🚀 Overview

This project demonstrates how **domestic and international transfers** can be unified under a single architecture capable of:
- Supporting **multiple fiat or digital currencies** (MXN, USD, etc.).
- Handling **real-time exchange rate optimization** via algorithmic conversion.
- Integrating **STP logic** (domestic transfer simulation) and **Interledger-style settlement**.
- Working with **modular APIs** for easy extension into financial applications.

The design allows users to simulate **wallet creation, transfer requests, and rate optimization** between participants, even when using distinct ledgers.
